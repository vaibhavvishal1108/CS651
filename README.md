This is a Rails application of a simple Photosite
In this project the first url:user/index will display the a webpage that lists the information of all the users (userid, first name, last name). Clicking on the users first name , which is a link will navigate to the second url :/photo/index/id .This page will display the user photo, photo creation time , comments on that photo and comment created time, name of the user who commented.
Each photo is synced with my AWS S3 bucket
